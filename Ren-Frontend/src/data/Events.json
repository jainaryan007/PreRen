The goal is to pull the opponent‚Äôs bot across the centerline to claim victory. The event tests engineering, design, and tactical skills while navigating through obstacles.\n\nArena:\n‚Ä¢ The arena is divided into two zones:\n  Zone 1: Speed breaker hurdles made of semi-cylindrical pipes.\n  Zone 2: Hurdles consisting of stones and pebbles.\n Bots are tied head-to-head via a rope.\n The actual arena may slightly vary due to practical constraints.\n\nGameplay:\n Two bots start the match tied together with a rope.\n The objective is to pull the opponent‚Äôs bot across the centerline into your zone.\n The match lasts for a maximum of 3 minutes.\n If no bot pulls the other into its zone, points are awarded based on the opponent‚Äôs position in the arena.\n Teams that qualify in the first round will compete in the second round.\n‚Ä¢ The team that defeats all others is declared the winner.\n\nMarking Scheme:\n If a bot successfully pulls the opponent bot across the hurdles, the team gains 50 points and is declared the winner.\n If neither bot pulls the other into their zone, points are awarded based on how far the opponent was dragged:\n  If Bot1 is in Zone 1: Bot2 gets 5 points.\n  If Bot1 crosses Zone 1 and is in Zone 2: Bot2 gets 15 points.\n  If Bot1 crosses Zone 2 and reaches Zone 3: Bot2 gets 30 points.\n In case of a tie, the bot that pulled the opponent the furthest in the allotted time will be declared the winner.\n If a bot‚Äôs attachment is disfigured or malfunctions during the battle, 10 points will be deducted.\n If the rope disconnects, the match will pause, and the rope will be re-tied. Time will be stopped during this process and resumed after re-tying.\n The winner is the bot with the highest points or the one that successfully pulls the opponent across the centerline.\n\nBot Specifications:\n Bots can be wired or wireless.\n Maximum weight allowed: 6 Kg (including battery weight).\n Allowed power supply: Both onboard and offboard.\n The bot must fit within 300mm x 300mm x 250mm (+10% tolerance allowed).\n‚Ä¢ Voltage limit: Max 24V.\n For wired bots, the cable must not exceed 3 meters in length.\n Use of ready-made Lego kits or pre-built mechanisms is not allowed.\n Pre-assembled gear systems and wireless modules are permitted.\n Bots will be inspected before the event; failure to meet specifications will result in disqualification.\n Pneumatic, hydraulic, cutter, projectile, and entanglement mechanisms are strictly prohibited.\n Damaging the arena will result in disqualification.\n The bot must have a designated attachment point for tying the rope.\n\nRules and Regulations:\nTeams must consist of 1-3 participants.\nA participant cannot be part of multiple teams.\nContestants are not allowed to touch their bots during the match.\nOnly one team member can control the bot.\nIf a bot stops working during the match:\n    The team gets one chance to fix the issue within 1 minute (match time will pause).\n    If the bot stops again, time will not be paused, and the team can continue fixing it.\n    If repairs take more than 2 minutes, the team will be disqualified.\nWires must remain slack at all times; if not:\n    First offense: Warning.\n    Further offenses: 5-point deduction per instance.\nThe event will be recorded via an overhead camera for review.\nOnly DC power supply is allowed; no AC power supply will be provided.\nTeams must report within 5 minutes of being called for their match.\nThe judge‚Äôs decision is final.\n\nTeam Specifications:\n Each team must have 1-3 participants.\n\nPool Prize:\nRs 20000/-\n\nEvent Coordinators:\nSaksham Saraf : +91 9772771754\n",
