 	Referee’s Command: The match begins only after the referee calls "Go" or gives the signal to start.
 	Winning: A competitor wins by pinning the opponent’s hand to the table or forcing their arm beyond a certain range (usually 90 degrees).
 	Fouls: A foul can occur if a competitor leaves the starting position, twists the wrist too aggressively, or uses illegal grips (e.g., thumb hooks).
	Best of Three: Some events may use a "best of three" format to determine the winner.
 	No Slipping: If the hands slip, the referee resets the match without a winner unless there’s a foul.
 	Safety: Protecting joints and avoiding excessive force is critical; any signs of injury will halt the match for evaluation.

EVENT NAME - ROBO-WAR

Problem Statement:
To design a machine that can fight another one. The competition will be played on a knock-out basis. The maximum weight of the bot should be 30 Kg.

RULES:
• The competition will be played on a knock-out basis.
• The maximum duration of each round will be 2 minutes. Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be disqualified from the competition automatically.
• If the bot is unable to displace from its position for more than 30 sec, then the bot would be disqualified from the particular round.
• No AC power supply will be provided for the bots; participants are requested to use only DC power supply.
• The machine would be checked for its safety before the competition and would be discarded if found unsafe for other participants and spectators.
• The organizers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit. Change in rules, if any, will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered teams. Violation of any of the above rules will lead to disqualification.
• A person is allowed to control only one bot in the tournament.

Arena:
• Total arena dimensions: 20x20 feet. Playing arena dimensions: 17X17 feet.
• Knock-out arena dimensions: 3X3 feet.
• The base of the arena is made up of a metal sheet of width 5 mm.
• The walls of the arena will be made up of polycarbonate film of width 6mm.

Machine Specification:
• The following size limitations apply for each robot: Width-750mm max, Length-750mm max, Height-1000mm max.
• Maximum weight of the machine should not exceed 30 kg, including the power source for Robo-war Pro.
• The machine can use a maximum of 24 volts at any given point of time to any particular component of the robot. The machine can be operated with a wired or wireless remote. Ready-made bases of machines would not be allowed (Readymade wheels, motor, battery, RF Remote, switch, wires can be used).

Power Sources:

The machine can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not allowed.

Each team must have its own power sources. The teams have to bring their own battery eliminators.

The voltage difference between any two points in the machine should not be more than 36V DC at any point of time.

All connections should be made safe to prevent short circuits and battery fires. Any unsafe circuitry may be asked to be replaced. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.

Use of damaged, non-leak-proof batteries may lead to disqualification.

Change of battery will not be allowed during the match.

It is suggested to have extra batteries ready and charged up during the competition so that on advancing to the next level, you don't have to wait or suffer due to an uncharged battery. If teams don't show up on the allotted slot, they will be disqualified.

Mobility:

All robots must have clearly visible and controlled mobility mechanisms in order to compete.

Methods of mobility may include:
• Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).
• Walking (linear actuated legs with no rolling or cam-operated motion).
• Shuffling (rotational cam-operated legs).

Jumping and hopping are not allowed.

Flying (using aerofoils, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.) is not allowed.
*Any other method of mobility which leads the robot to lose contact with the ground is not allowed.

Robot Control Requirements:

Both wired and wireless remote controls are allowed in the event.

All wires coming out of the robot should be bundled as a single unit.

The wires should be properly protected and insulated.

The wire should be sufficiently long so as to remain slack at all times during the competition.

In case of wireless remote controls, the remote should have at least two frequency operations to prevent interference with other teams.

Teams are recommended to attach a pipe to the bot in a vertical direction through which wires come out. The length of the pipe will not be considered in the bot dimension.

Rules for Pneumatics and Hydraulics:

The robot must use non-inflammable and non-corrosive fluids to power pneumatic and hydraulic devices.

Maximum pressure in the tank containing pneumatic fluid should not exceed the limit of 10 bars, and there should be a provision to check the pressure in the tank.

All hydraulic liquids are required to be non-corrosive, and your device should be leak-proof. The maximum pressure in the cylinder should not exceed the rated pressure at any point in time.

Participants must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted pressure gauges.

You must have a safe way of refilling the system.

All pneumatic components on board a robot must be securely mounted. Care must be taken while mounting the pressure vessel and armor to ensure that if ruptured, it will not escape the robot.

Safety Rules:
Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.

Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries and pneumatics. Robots without proper protection will not be allowed to compete.

If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers. Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the organizers with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.

Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder, you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.

Proper activation and deactivation of robots are critical. Robots must only be activated in the arena, testing areas, or with expressed consent of the event coordinators.

All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.

All participants build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulation that can encompass all the dangers involved. Please take care to not hurt yourself or others when building, testing, and competing. Any kind of activity (repairing, battery handling, pneumatics systems, etc.) which may cause damage to the surroundings during the stay of the teams in the competition area should not be carried out without the consent of the organizers. Not following this rule may result in disqualification.

All the resources provided at the time of competition from the organizers should be strictly used only after the consent of the organizers.

Once the robots enter the arena, no team member can enter the arena at any point in time. In case if a fight has to be stopped, the organizers will handle the situation.

NOTE:
Qualification of a robot to the next level is subjective and totally on the decision of the judges. A robot winning in a round against its opponent doesn’t guarantee its entrance into the next round. If the judges find the winning robot incompetent to enter into the next round, it may get disqualified. Judges can disqualify both the robots of a match from advancing to the next round.

Certificate Policy:

Top three teams will be rewarded and given prizes.

Certificates of participation will be only given to the participating teams.

Registration Amount: Rs1200/-(per Team)
